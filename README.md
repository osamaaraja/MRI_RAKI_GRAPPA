# RAKI Implementation

### Description
This is the implementation of the original RAKI paper "Scan-specific robust artificial-neural-networks for k-space interpolation (RAKI) reconstruction: Database-free deep learning for fast imaging".

You can read the original paper [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.27420). The source code is also available by the authors in Tensorflow; however, this implementation is based on the original code but implemented in Pytorch.
